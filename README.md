## Hi, I'm Svetlana  👋

I am a developer transitioning into mobile development using Dart and Flutter.

I have a bacground in C and C#, including Unity-based projects,
and experience working with visual assets and interactive applications.
This helps me approach Flutter development with a strong focus on
UI structure, consistency, and usability.

### Current focus

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Dart and Flutter for mobile development
- 🔭 I’m working on small Flutter apps to build strong fundamentals
- 💬 Ask me about C, C#, Unity, and my Flutter learning journey
